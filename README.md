### How I approached the project:

The steps include,

1. Understanding the layout design file/requirements
2. Defining the project scope
3. Assessing available resources
4. Thought to take risk to build in react + redux + shopify API. 
5. Documentation

### what I liked, didnâ€™t like, and faced issues

I love to learn new technologies and update myself. As I am new to Shopify, I want to learn Shopify Concepts,API's, data structures, components etc., in a short span of time to develop this project. I've faced issues in development phase which gave me a great challenge on a project implementation/Testing/fixing bugs and push my work towards deadline.
